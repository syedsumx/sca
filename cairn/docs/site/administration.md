# Administration

## Install

* **Docker Compose** for evaluation and small installs: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set every
  `CHANGE_ME`, then `docker compose -f docker-compose.cairn.yml up -d`. Open port 9000.
* **Kubernetes**: the `cairn` Helm chart. Bring your own MySQL 8, OpenSearch 2 and Kafka 3; put the
  secrets in a Kubernetes Secret named `cairn-core-secrets` (see the chart's values file).

## Accounts

* `admin` is the built-in root account; its password is `CAIRN_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Use it to set up
  single sign-on and roles, then keep it for break-glass use.
* The control plane runs as `cairn-service`, a least-privilege service account created at install.
  It cannot manage policies, users, credentials, secrets or other people's tokens. Its token is
  rotated every `CAIRN_TOKEN_ROTATE_DAYS` days (default 7).
* User provisioning (SCIM) writes as `cairn-provisioner`, which may manage people and groups and
  nothing else. Keeping it apart means the control plane can never change group membership, and so
  never its own access. Its token is rotated the same way and only the API service can read it.
* People create their own access tokens under **Settings → Access Tokens**.

## Single sign-on

Cairn signs people in with any OpenID Connect identity provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Google,
Keycloak, Auth0 and others). Password sign-in stays available for `admin`.

1. In the identity provider, create a web application (authorization code flow) and register the
   redirect URI `<CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL>/callback/oidc`, for example
   `https://cairn.example.com/callback/oidc`.
2. Set `CAIRN_SSO_CLIENT_ID`, `CAIRN_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` and `CAIRN_SSO_DISCOVERY_URL` (the
   provider's `.../.well-known/openid-configuration` address).
3. Check the settings before switching sign-in on:

   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.cairn.yml exec cairn-api cairn sso check
   ```

   It prints the redirect URI to register and checks the discovery document, signing keys, PKCE
   support and the client credentials (without signing anyone in). Fix anything marked `FAIL`.
4. Set `CAIRN_SSO_ENABLED=true` and restart `cairn-web`. The login page shows **Sign in with SSO**.

People are created on first sign-in, and the groups in their token's `groups` claim
(`CAIRN_SSO_GROUPS_CLAIM`) become Cairn groups, so personas and policies can refer to them. Other
settings: `CAIRN_SSO_SCOPE` (default `openid email profile`), `CAIRN_SSO_USER_CLAIM` (default
`preferred_username`) and `CAIRN_SSO_REQUIRED_GROUPS` (only members of these groups may sign in).

## User provisioning (SCIM)

With SCIM 2.0 the identity provider creates, updates and deactivates people and groups ahead of
their first sign-in, and removes access when someone leaves.

* Base URL: `<CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL>/cairn/api/scim/v2`
* Authentication: bearer token, the value of `CAIRN_SCIM_TOKEN` (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
* Supported: Users and Groups (create, read, replace, patch, delete), filters on `userName`,
  `externalId`, `displayName` and `id`, pagination.

A SCIM user's `userName` is the Cairn user name, so it must match what single sign-on provides
(`CAIRN_SSO_USER_CLAIM`). Deleting a user deactivates them; their ownership and history stay. Group
membership changes take effect on policy decisions within seconds. When groups come from SCIM, set
`CAIRN_SSO_EXTRACT_GROUPS=false` so sign-in does not also rewrite them.

## Main settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CAIRN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | root account password |
| `CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL` | URL users reach Cairn on (used in notification links) |
| `CAIRN_AUTHZ_MODE`, `CAIRN_NATIVE_POLICIES_ENABLED` | additive or authoritative governance |
| `CAIRN_LLM_PROVIDER`, `CAIRN_AI_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CAIRN_OLLAMA_URL` | assistant model |
| `CAIRN_SLACK_*`, `CAIRN_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`, `CAIRN_SMTP_URL` | notification channels |
| `CAIRN_EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | sites allowed to embed Cairn components |
| `CAIRN_TOKEN_ROTATE_DAYS`, `CAIRN_TOKEN_GRACE_MINUTES` | service token rotation |
| `CAIRN_SSO_*` | single sign-on (see above) |
| `CAIRN_SCIM_TOKEN` | SCIM provisioning token |
| `CAIRN_MCL_INVALIDATION` | apply metadata changes to access decisions at once (default `true`) |

Secrets (`CAIRN_*_SECRET`, `*_KEY`, `*_PASSWORD`) must be long random values
(`openssl rand -hex 32`).

## Network

Users only need the edge (port 9000, or your ingress). The internal APIs are not exposed; developer
consoles are disabled at the edge.

**HTTPS.** Put the certificate chain and key (PEM) in `deploy/tls/` as `tls.crt` and `tls.key`, or
point `CAIRN_TLS_DIR` at another directory, and restart the edge. It then also serves HTTPS on port
9443 (`CAIRN_MAPPED_EDGE_TLS_PORT`) with TLS 1.2+ and HSTS. Set `CAIRN_TLS_REDIRECT=true` to send
plain HTTP to HTTPS (`CAIRN_TLS_PUBLIC_PORT` is the port users reach, default 443), and set
`CAIRN_PUBLIC_URL` to the `https://` address. On Kubernetes, TLS is the ingress's job.

**Rate limits.** Per client address: password sign-in 10 attempts a minute (bursts of 20), the Cairn
API 50 requests a second (bursts of 400). Over the limit, the edge answers `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Secrets as files

Any `CAIRN_*` secret can be given as a file instead: `CAIRN_DB_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db` sets
`CAIRN_DB_PASSWORD` to the file's content (Docker secrets, Kubernetes secret volumes, Vault agent).
Setting both forms is an error, so a stale value cannot hide the file. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE` works
the same way.

## Reports

**Reports** in the workspace answers the two questions that fund a catalog: is it used, and is the estate getting governed? It has four sections:

- **Coverage:** the share of datasets that are described, owned, classified, certified and monitored. It is shown overall, by domain and by platform. Click any figure to list the datasets that lack it.
- **Adoption:** weekly and monthly active users (people who opened an asset), asset views over 7 days, access requests over 30 days (submitted, approved and pending), and the median time to a decision.
- **Quality:** open incidents, the monitored share, and the mean time to resolve. The resolve time is measured from a monitor's first failure to its next pass, over 30 days.
- **Governance:** personas, purposes, active grants, and grants that expire within 7 days.

A snapshot is computed once a day by the notifier and kept per day, so the history shows the trend. **Recompute now** refreshes it on demand, and **Download CSV** exports coverage by domain and by platform. Reports are for administrators (`MANAGE_GLOBAL_SETTINGS`). Set `CAIRN_REPORTS_OPEN=true` to show them to everyone who is signed in; the drill-down lists still show each person only the datasets they may see.

The API, under `/cairn/api/reports`:

- `GET` returns the latest snapshot,
- `POST /refresh` recomputes it,
- `GET /history?days=90` returns the headline figures per day,
- `GET /coverage.csv` exports coverage,
- `GET /assets?missing=owner&domain=urn:li:domain:finance` lists the datasets behind a figure (`domain=none` means no domain; `platform=` filters by platform).

### Cost per asset

**Reports → Cost** lists two kinds of table:

- **Idle tables:** no reads in 30 days and nothing downstream in lineage, ranked by what they cost to store.
- **Expensive per read:** tables whose storage and query cost is high for how rarely they are read.

**Propose deprecation** notifies the table's owners and followers with the figures behind the proposal.

Daily figures per table come from warehouse collectors, which run once a day for the previous day. Configure them in `CAIRN_COST_SOURCES`, a YAML file whose `sources` entries use the named connections:

- **Snowflake** (`platform: snowflake`) reads `ACCOUNT_USAGE`:
  - storage from `TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS`, priced at `storage_usd_per_tb_month` (default 23),
  - compute from `QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY` credits, priced at `credit_usd` (default 3), split evenly across the tables each query read (`ACCESS_HISTORY`).

  The connection's role needs access to the `SNOWFLAKE` database.
- **BigQuery** (`platform: bigquery`, `region: region-us`) reads `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`:
  - `TABLE_STORAGE` logical bytes, at `storage_usd_per_gib_month`,
  - `JOBS` bytes billed, at `usd_per_tib`, split across the referenced tables.

For other sources, post daily rows to `POST /cairn/api/reports/costs` (`{"rows": [{urn, day, storage_bytes, storage_usd, compute_usd, reads}]}`). Posting a dataset and day again replaces that row.

The rest of the API is under `/cairn/api/reports/costs`:

- `GET /idle?days=30` and `GET /expensive?days=30` return the two lists,
- `GET /asset?urn=…` returns one table's daily series,
- `POST /propose-deprecation` with `{"urn", "reason"}` sends the proposal.

## Monitoring

Every Cairn service exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`. Workers without an HTTP API (notifier, scheduler, context miner) serve them on `CAIRN_METRICS_PORT`; Helm sets it to 9108.

**Metrics:**

| Metric | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `cairn_http_requests_total`, `cairn_http_request_seconds` | requests and latency per service and route |
| `cairn_pdp_decisions_total{decision,mode}`, `cairn_pdp_decision_seconds` | authorization decisions and their latency |
| `cairn_quality_evaluations_total{type,status}`, `cairn_quality_incidents_total{event}` | monitor runs and incidents |
| `cairn_notifications_total{channel,outcome}`, `cairn_notifications_pending` | deliveries and backlog |
| `cairn_ai_tokens_total`, `cairn_ai_cost_usd_total`, `cairn_ai_budget_refusals_total` | AI use per task |
| `cairn_audit_events_total{category}` | audit log entries |
| `cairn_worker_last_success_timestamp_seconds{worker}`, `cairn_worker_errors_total` | background worker health |
| `cairn_proxy_masked_total{policy}` | values the core proxy masked |

**Dashboards and alerts** live in `deploy/observability/`:

- `cairn-overview.json`, a Grafana dashboard,
- `cairn-alerts.yaml`, Prometheus rules (checked with `promtool` in CI) covering: a service down, server errors above 5%, slow requests, slow policy decisions, a spike in denials, a stalled or failing worker, a notification backlog or failing channel, a burst of quality incidents, and the AI budget reached.

**To run them:**

- **Compose:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.cairn.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d` adds Prometheus (`localhost:9090`) and Grafana (`localhost:3300`, with `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`), pre-loaded with both.
- **Helm:** `cairn.serviceMonitor.enabled` scrapes the services and the workers (a ServiceMonitor and a PodMonitor). `cairn.prometheusRule.enabled` installs the rules, and `cairn.grafanaDashboard.enabled` installs the dashboard as a ConfigMap for the Grafana sidecar.

**Tracing** is optional OpenTelemetry. Install the `otel` extra and set `CAIRN_OTEL_ENDPOINT` to an OTLP/HTTP collector. Requests, outgoing calls and database queries are then traced, sampled at `CAIRN_OTEL_SAMPLE_RATIO` (default 10%). Health and metrics endpoints are not traced.

## High availability

`helm/cairn/values-ha.yaml` is a profile for production clusters:

```bash
helm install cairn ./helm/cairn -f my-values.yaml -f helm/cairn/values-ha.yaml
```

- **Stateless services** (API, policy service, core proxy) run 3 replicas, and the MCP server and workspace UI run 2. Each component's replicas are spread over nodes and zones (`cairn.ha.spreadReplicas`), and a PodDisruptionBudget keeps enough of them up during node drains.
- **Workers** (scheduler, notifier, context miner) run 2 replicas. A Postgres advisory lock makes one of them the leader for each cycle, so work is never done twice. If the leader's node goes away, the standby takes over on its next cycle.
- **The gateway** runs more than one replica only when its keys come from a shared Secret (`gateway.keys.existingSecret`). Without one, the keys live on a volume, the gateway runs a single replica and it gets no PodDisruptionBudget.
- **Databases:** point `global.*` at managed, replicated Postgres, MySQL and OpenSearch. The databases the chart can run are single instances.

## Backup and restore

Docker Compose deployments are backed up with one script:

```bash
deploy/ops/backup.sh                    # writes backups/cairn-<timestamp>/
deploy/ops/restore.sh backups/cairn-<timestamp>
```

**A backup holds:**

- the Cairn database (`pg_dump`),
- the catalog database (`mysqldump --single-transaction`),
- the gateway's identity keys, so remote agents keep trusting it,
- `config/`,
- a `manifest.json` with each file's checksum, the Cairn version and the schema revision.

Both dumps are consistent and taken while Cairn runs. The search index is not backed up: it is rebuilt from the catalog database.

**A restore** first checks the checksums and asks you to confirm. It then:

1. stops Cairn, but not its databases,
2. replaces both databases and the gateway keys,
3. rebuilds the search index,
4. starts Cairn again.

Anything written after the backup was taken is lost. `config/` is unpacked only with `RESTORE_CONFIG=1`. Backups contain secrets and personal data, so keep them encrypted.

On Kubernetes, use your database service's backups (point-in-time recovery) and back up the gateway key Secret. After restoring the catalog database, rebuild the index by running the setup image with `-u RestoreIndices -a clean`.

## Audit log

Denied access decisions, policy, persona and purpose changes, grants, access requests,
certification approvals, user provisioning and remote-agent activity are written to a hash-chained
audit log: altering or deleting an entry breaks the chain.

* **Check it**: `cairn audit verify`, or `GET /cairn/api/governance/audit/verify`.
* **Export it** to a SIEM or an archive, in chain order:
  `GET /cairn/api/governance/audit/export?after_seq=<last seq>&format=jsonl` (or `csv`; filters
  `since`, `until`, `category`), or `cairn audit export --out audit.jsonl`. `--follow` keeps
  writing new entries, for a log shipper.
* **Verify an export** without database access: `cairn audit verify-file audit.jsonl`. Pass the
  previous export's `head` with `--after-head` to prove nothing is missing in between.

## Upgrades

Run the new version's images. The `cairn-setup` job migrates the catalog's schema, indices and topics
before the services start, and the control-plane services migrate their own database on start (one
at a time, under a database lock). Read the release notes for setting changes first.

```bash
cairn db current     # schema revision of the control-plane database, and the latest one
cairn db check       # non-zero exit if the schema is not at the latest revision or differs from it
```

Back up before upgrading (`deploy/ops/backup.sh`, see [Backup and restore](#backup-and-restore)); migrations move forward only.
